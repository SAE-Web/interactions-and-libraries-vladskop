Over the past few weeks, you have been learning about LGBT computing heroes by added them into arrays or by creating objects.

Now that you know how to create interactions on your web page, create the following:

1. On your web page, create a button and wire it to a listener. Confirm this has been set up correctly.


2. Create a list from the names of heroes. When user clicks the button, make it so that it selects a random hero. Display that hero on the page.


3. Extend the list so that instead of an array of strings, it's an array of objects. Now return the object and display the properties on the page.
