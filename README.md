There are 3 Tasks in this folder.

Task 1 will allow you to practice working with interactions.

Task 2 will build on task 1 and with the objects created over the past few weeks, so please make sure those are completed.

Task 3 will help you make use of libraries-this will be essential as we move forward in the following weeks.
