In task 2 you created a button that would return a random hero you created in the previous weeks. 

1. Head over to [momentjs.com](https://moment.github.io/luxon/index.html) and download the JS file into your project. Make sure you connect it into the webpage.


2. Looking at how you can use luxon, writing `moment.format()` will return the current date and time. Get this to appear on the page.


3. Now, use some of the formatting options so that only the day appears-so as it's Wednesday, it should say that.


4. Turning your attention back to the heroes, you'll notice each of them have a date. Use the formatting functions within luxon.js to show the date as `Date of Month, Year`


5. (Challenge) Now that you can find the current date, and can create a date from the hero's date of birth, use Luxon's formatting to show how many years ago the hero was born.
